            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was convinced that color photography was the wave of the future, so he won Tzar's special permission to travel across the vast Russian Empire and take color photographs of everything he saw, including the only color portrait of Leo Tolstoy. 
                He recorded three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter. In this project, we will take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a color image. 
                Specifically, the code will extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them to form a single RGB color image.

            <h2>Single Scale Alignment</h2>
            <p>For images with lower resolutions, the easiest way to align the three-channel images is to exhaustively search over a window of possible displacements and score each using a metric. 
                We can then take the displacement with the best score. As suggested in the project description, I used a displacement range of [-15,15] pixels.
                Regarding the scoring metric, I experimented with the Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) and Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC). 
                I found that SAD performed better for the single-scale alignment. However, the images were still not very well aligned. To further improve performance, 
                I decided to crop the borders of the images by 10%. This improved the performance tremendously.

            <h2>Multichannel</h2>
            <p>Multichannel processing involves data from multiple sources or inputs. For example, stereo audio, RGB image channels, and sensor arrays use multiple channels of data to provide more detailed information and enable richer processing.</p>
