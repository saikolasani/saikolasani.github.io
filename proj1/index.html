            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was convinced that color photography was the wave of the future, so he won Tzar's special permission to travel across the vast Russian Empire and take color photographs of everything he saw, including the only color portrait of Leo Tolstoy. 
                He recorded three exposures of every scene onto a glass plate using a red, a green, and a blue filter. In this project, we will take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a color image. 
                Specifically, the code will extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them to form a single RGB color image.

            <h2>Single Scale Alignment</h2>
            <p>For images with lower resolutions, the easiest way to align the three-channel images is to exhaustively search over a window of possible displacements and score each using a metric. 
                We can then take the displacement with the best score. As suggested in the project description, I used a displacement range of [-15,15] pixels.
                I experimented with the Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) and Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) regarding the scoring metric. 
                I found that SAD performed better for the single-scale alignment. However, the images were still not very well aligned. To further improve performance, 
                I decided to crop the borders of the images by 10%. This improved the performance tremendously.

            <h2>Multi Scale Alignment</h2>
            <p>However, the exhaustive search would become too computationally expensive for images with higher resolutions and larger displacements.
                To combat this issue, I implemented an Image pyramid that searches for shifts in multiple scales. 
            </p>
             <h3>Algorithm Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Downscale both the reference image and the image to align using multiple scaling factors. Starting with the coarsest (smallest) image and working to the finest (full resolution).</li>
                <li>Similarly to single scale, crop 10% of the image borders at each scale to focus on the central region.</li>
                <li>At each scale, search for the best displacement (shift) by trying different pixel shifts in height and width directions.</li>
                <li>For each shift, calculate a similarity score using normalized cross-correlation.</li>
                <li>Once the best displacement is found at a coarse scale, adjust the search range for the next finer scale using the best shift found so far.</li>
                <li>After refining the alignment at all scales, apply the final best displacement to the original image to align it with the reference image.</li>
            </ol>
